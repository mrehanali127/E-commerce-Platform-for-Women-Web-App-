## Overview
As we are living in an era of technology, everywhere you are getting help from computer 
technology intentionally or unintentionally. From small work to tough work we are using 
websites on our mobile phones or laptops. Like for watching movies, games and for office 
works also. For web development project, we decided to get real problem from the 
world and solve it by app so users by using an web app can solve that problem easily with 
the help of new technology. I have made a website on which one kind of user can show their 
products and another kind of user can buy their products by contacting them. For 
development, I have used <b>“vscode”</b> as a tool. I have used <b>"java script"</b> as front end language 
and used <b>“Flask”</b> framework of python for backend logic. To store information about user's 
credentials and products I have used the <b>"MySQL Database"</b>. By using this web app users 
can view handmade crafts and can place an order of what want to get. The seller can also 
add new products. We have tried our best to design a flexible user interface so that any kind 
of user can use our product without any further guide and any hesitation
